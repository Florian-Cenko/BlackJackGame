üéÆ How to Play
1. Place your bet: At the beginning of each round, you'll be prompted to enter how many chips you'd like to bet.

2. Player's turn: After the initial cards are dealt, you can choose to either "Hit" (get another card) or "Stand" (end your turn).

3. Dealer's turn: The dealer will automatically hit until they reach a value of 17 or more.

4. End of round: After both the player and the dealer complete their turns, the winner is determined:

   -If the player's total hand value exceeds 21, they bust and lose the bet.

   -If the dealer's hand exceeds 21, the dealer busts and the player wins.

   -If the player's hand value is higher than the dealer's, the player wins.

   -If both hands have the same value, it's a tie (push).

5. Play again: After each round, you can choose to play again.
